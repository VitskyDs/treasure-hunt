      <p>
        Here, where you once spoke words of love, another couple once walked in
        the night. It was June 16, 1933. Dr. Haim Arlosoroff, a leader of the
        Yishuv (the settlement in Israel before there was a state), strolled
        along the beach with his wife, Sima.
      </p>
      <p>
        He had just returned from Europe, where he sought ways to save Jewish
        lives from the gathering storm. His work stirred enemies, and shadows
        followed him.
      </p>
      <p>
        On this very shoreline, two men appeared. A brief exchange, a flash, a
        shot — and Arlosoroff fell. His wife cried for help, but the killers
        melted into darkness.
      </p>
      <p>
        To this day, no one knows for certain who pulled the trigger, or why.
      </p>
      <p>This is the mystery you must unravel.</p>

      <Riddle>
        The waves remember, but the light of knowledge is not kept by the sea.
        Seek instead the fire of study, written into the city’s heart — where
        words and flavors once met.

              You have read the city’s riddle. The next rune awaits not on the
              shore, but where words once mingled with sweetness — at Cafe
              Daisy.
            </p>
            <p>
              Go now to Cafe Daisy, on the corner of Ibn Gabirol and Arlosoroff.
              Search carefully: the rune is hidden where travelers pause, near
              the tables where stories were once exchanged.
